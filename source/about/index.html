Hello this is about me.  i still don't know what i'm doing.

So, yes I do cloud platform work for a pacific northwest athletic clothing corporation.  I've managed to glom on to aws, ruby, a little go, as well as a lot of chef.

Been up here for more than 12 years.  working in the software development sphere for more years than i want to admint to.

I've got a family, we like to do stuff together apart mostly.  Enjoy riding the motorcycle, driving the fiat, and walking the dogs.  If you see me give me a hello.

Thanks for reading
