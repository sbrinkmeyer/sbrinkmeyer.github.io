# Boiling an ocean

Texted my best friend about being tired.  Why, cause I've been working at boiling the ocean now since June.  She said, "those who can do".  Damn do i just set that bag of bricks down ... then what?

## lets go to the cloud

what have you got?  Nothing.  Well all right then where do i sign up?

seriously, naive.  so many things just worked before and then suddenly working in the brand new enviornment only to be hit by so many things i didn't know i didn't know.

... more to come ... right here
