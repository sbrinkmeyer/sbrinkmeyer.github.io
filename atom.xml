    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>you can blame Irving</h1>

<p>I worked with Irving back in the day.  He was really a good person to work with.  Really smart.  Enjoyed it very much.  Maybe a littly jealous about him moving on.  Though, when he left it did open up a spot for me.  I don&rsquo;t know if it was his leaving or Justin&rsquo;s, but that is what gave me an opening.</p>

<h2>Amazement</h2>

<p>It was that time on the phone call with those support people where you really got me. I still tell the story about you walking the data center support guy (unseen) through the F5 interface and telling them exactly what they were seeing.  Then when they challenged what it was that you were looking at.  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s an error code.  that means &lsquo;this&rsquo; &hellip;. &rdquo;.  Wow, &hellip; ;) just wow.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so happy for you ending up where you ended up at.</p>

<h1>Still Here</h1>

<p>Thankfully I&rsquo;m still here.  I&rsquo;m still learning, still growing.  Now I still get to work with Irving.  He&rsquo;s my success engineer or something now.  He&rsquo;s probably so very done with dealing with me but &hellip; oh well.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Boiling an ocean</h1>

<p>Texted my best friend about being tired.  Why, cause I&rsquo;ve been working at boiling the ocean now since June.  She said, &ldquo;those who can do&rdquo;.  Damn do i just set that bag of bricks down &hellip; then what?</p>

<h2>lets go to the cloud</h2>

<p>what have you got?  Nothing.  Well all right then where do i sign up?</p>

<p>seriously, naive.  so many things just worked before and then suddenly working in the brand new enviornment only to be hit by so many things i didn&rsquo;t know i didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>&hellip; more to come &hellip; right here</p>
